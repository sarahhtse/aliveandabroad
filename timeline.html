	  			<li>This is one of the MOST crucial steps that take a LONG time so it is essential that you do this early.</li>
	  			<li>If you hear back earlier than the suggested dates, do this step ASAP.</li>
	  			<li>At Aalto University, there are two main housing organizations that take 5ever to offer you a place. Here are the links to their sites: <a href = "https://ayy.fi/en/housing/apartment-seekers/how-to-apply-for-housing/ayy-housing-for-exchange-students-instructions/">AYY </a>and <a href="https://www.hoas.fi/exchange/applicants/">HOAS</a>.</li>
	  			<li>For Finland, you need a residence permit. Aalto will send you the information that you need to follow. </li>
	  			<li>I want to note here that the digital fingerprinting is done through a third party now so, you don't have to travel out of state to the consulates to get your permit. It is done with <a href = "http://www.vfsglobal.com/Finland/USA/">VFS Global </a>.</li>
